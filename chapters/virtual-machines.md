# Virtual Machines
A Virtual Machine (VM) is the virtualization/emulation of a computer system. In other words, a Virtual Machine is a server that _acts and looks like_ a physical machine: you have control over it, you can install/uninstall software in it and configure it as you want.

In Azure, you can choose the system used in the Virtual Machines between Windows or Linux.

## Pricing
Azure offers a lot of configuration & princing options, ranging from cents to one or two dollars per hour, depending on the VM instance you selected.
The VM instances with more compute power cost more, while the smaller ones/less powerfull are cheaper.


When you select a VM instance from a specific range (around the mid price to the high prices), you have the option to select a payment commitment:
* Pay as you go
* 1 year reserved (~60% discount)
* 3 year reserved (~78% discount)

If you are sure you're going to use a VM for a year or three years, selecting the respective payment commitment can save you money.
If you choose the _pay as you go_ option, you will be charged the standard way - per usage.

You can also select whether you want the compute payment to be done **monthly** or **upfront**.

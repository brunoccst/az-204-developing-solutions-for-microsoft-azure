# Virtual Machines
A Virtual Machine (VM) is the virtualization/emulation of a computer system. In other words, a Virtual Machine is a server that _acts and looks like_ a physical machine: you have control over it, you can install/uninstall software in it and configure it as you want.

In Azure, you can choose the system used in the Virtual Machines between Windows or Linux.

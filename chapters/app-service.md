# App Services

An App Service can be considered as an abstraction of a Virtual Machine. It removes the need of configuring the machine to deploy applications, leaving code deployment as the only responsibility for the developer. While in a **VM** you need to set its operating system, hardware configuration and other infrastructure settings as well as deploying code, in an **app service** you only need to care about deploying code. Because of its nature, an app service is defined as a **Platform as a Service** (SaaS).
